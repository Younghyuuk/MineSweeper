It took us all around 3 - 4 hours to write our individual solutions each using IntelliJ. 
To do our official solution it took about 2 hours to clean everything up and create more modular and robust code. 
Generator code took about 30 minutes within the 3 - 4 hours it took for our individual solutions. 
Unit tests were a bit tricky since we had to change our provate methods and classes to default or package level to access them taking us around an hour and a half. 
Our solutions should have all the necessary components for this assignment.
